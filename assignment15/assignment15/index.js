so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.

• Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the
name of the guest who can’t make it.

• Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person
you are inviting.

• Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.*/
